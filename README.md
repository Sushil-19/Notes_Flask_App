# Notes_Flask_App

This is the Flask Application which can be used to store the notes by logging in.

There is no actual practical use of this application but I made this to get started again with flask after 4 years and store the application of flask in my repositories.
I will soon make another project in flask which is fully practical to use and implementable in  real life.
